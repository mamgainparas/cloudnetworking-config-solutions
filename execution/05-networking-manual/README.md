# Manual Networking Setup for PSC

**NOTE** : Please skip this step if you are not provisioning a producer service using [Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect).

## Overview

This stage establishes a Private Service Connect (PSC) connection between your consumer and the producer service you created in the previous "04-producer" step. This is done by creating a forwarding rule that directs traffic from a reserved IP address to the PSC attachment on your producer service (e.g. Cloud SQL database). PSC enables secure and private communication within Google Cloud Platform (GCP), shielding your services from the public internet. This stage configures a Private Service Connect (PSC) connection between your consumer project and the producer services you've set up. It does this by creating:

1. **Internal IP Addresses:** Reserved within specific subnetworks in your consumer project, acting as private endpoints for the PSC connection.
2. **Forwarding Rules:** Directing traffic destined for these internal IPs to your producer services through the PSC connection.

## How It Works

This configuration is designed for flexibility. You can define multiple producer services within your `networking-manual.tfvars` file in the `configuration/` folder.

**Key Points:**

* **`google_compute_address`:**  This resource will create a new internal IP address if `ip_address` is specified for a `psc_endpoint` in your `networking-manual.tfvars` file. If no address is provided, it will automatically reserve an address.
* **`google_compute_forwarding_rule`:**  This resource sets up the forwarding rule, connecting the internal IP (or the automatically created one) to the `psc_service_attachment_link` of your producer service.

## Configuration

This stage uses a modularized approach. The `psc-forwarding-rules.tf` file in the root directory orchestrates the creation of multiple forwarding rules based on the configuration provided in the `networking-manual.tfvars` file in the `configuration/` folder.

While running this stage, please carefully note the following details:

- The variable `psc_endpoints` is a list of objects, where each object represents a connection to a producer service:

    - `endpoint_project_id`           = "your-consumer-project-id"  # Project where the forwarding rule is created
    - `producer_instance_project_id`  = "your-producer-project-id"  # Project hosting the service (e.g., Cloud SQL)
    - `producer_instance_name`        = "your-sql-instance-name"    # (Optional) Name of the producer service instance
    - `target`                       = "your-service-attachment-link" # (Optional) Service attachment link
    - `subnetwork_name`               = "your-subnetwork-name"     # Subnet for allocating the internal IP
    - `network_name`                  = "your-network-name"        # VPC network for the forwarding rule
    - `ip_address_literal`            = ""                 # (Optional) Specific internal IP, or leave empty for automatic allocation
    - `region`                       = "your-region"              # Region for the resources
    - `allow_psc_global_access`       = true/false                  # (Optional) Allow global access
    - `labels`                        = { key = "value" }           # (Optional) Labels for resources

- **Either `producer_instance_name` or `target` must be specified, but not both.**
- **Regions:** Ensure your producer service, subnetwork, and service attachment all reside within the same GCP region.
- **IP Addresses:** Verify the specified `ip_address_literal` values are available and not already in use.

## Example configuration/networking-manual.tfvars

Example 1: Connecting to a Cloud SQL instance

This example shows how to connect to a specific Cloud SQL instance using its name.

```
psc_endpoints = [
  {
    endpoint_project_id          = "your-consumer-project-id"
    producer_instance_project_id = "your-producer-project-id"
    producer_instance_name       = "your-cloud-sql-instance-name" 
    subnetwork_name              = "your-subnetwork-name"
    network_name                 = "your-network-name"
    ip_address_literal           = "10.128.0.20"  // Or leave empty for dynamic allocation
    region                       = "us-central1" 
    allow_psc_global_access      = false
    labels                       = { environment = "dev" }
  },
]
```

Example 2: Connecting to a service attachment

This example demonstrates connecting to a service attachment, which can represent a different type of producer service or a group of instances.

```
psc_endpoints = [
  {
    endpoint_project_id          = "your-consumer-project-id"
    producer_instance_project_id = "your-producer-project-id"
    target                       = "projects/your-project/regions/us-central1/serviceAttachments/your-service-attachment-name" 
    subnetwork_name              = "your-subnetwork-name"
    network_name                 = "your-network-name"
    ip_address_literal           = "" // Or specify an IP address if needed
    region                       = "us-central1"
    allow_psc_global_access      = false
    labels                       = { environment = "dev" }
  },
]
```

## Usage

**NOTE** : run the terraform commands with the -var-file referencing the `networking-manual.tfvars` present under the `/configuration` folder. 

Example :

1. **Initialize**: Run `terraform init`.
2. **Plan**: Run terraform plan -var-file=../../configuration/networking-manual.tfvars to review the planned changes.

```
terraform plan -var-file=../../configuration/networking-manual.tfvars
```
3. **Apply**: If the plan looks good, run terraform apply -var-file=../../configuration/networking-manual.tfvars to create or update the resources.

```
terraform apply -var-file=../../configuration/networking-manual.tfvars
```
